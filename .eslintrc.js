## Create a repository
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
You can store a variety of projects in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work. For more information, see "[About repositories](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories)." To learn more about open source projects, visit [OpenSource.org](https://opensource.org/about).
{% elsif ghes or ghae %}
You can store a variety of projects in {% data variables.product.product_name %} repositories, including innersource projects. With innersource, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. For more information on innersource, see {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s white paper "[An introduction to innersource](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/)."
{% endif %}
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% note %}
**Notes:** 
- You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a [license file](https://choosealicense.com/) that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. {% data reusables.open-source.open-source-guide-repositories %} 
- {% data reusables.open-source.open-source-learning %} 
- You can also add community health files to your repositories, to set guidelines on how to contribute, keep your repositories safe, and much more. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)." 
{% endnote %}
{% endif %}
{% webui %}
{% data reusables.repositories.create_new %}
2. Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
  ![Field for entering a repository name](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-name.png)
3. Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}."
  ![Field for entering a repository description](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-desc.png)
{% data reusables.repositories.choose-repo-visibility %}
{% data reusables.repositories.initialize-with-readme %}
{% data reusables.repositories.create-repo %}
Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a *README* file.
{% endwebui %}
Name :'Run'' 'Runs::/Script::/scripts::/build_script::/Name :Build and Deployee :'"{% "ci : CI" %}'":,'"'':Build::'
{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}
1. In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to create a local clone of your new project.
2. To create a repository for your project, use the `gh repo create` subcommand. When prompted, select **Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch** and enter the name of your new project. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of to your personal account, specify the organization name and project name with `organization-name/project-name`. 
3. Follow the interactive prompts. To clone the repository locally, confirm yes when asked if you would like to clone the remote project directory.  
4. Alternatively, to skip the prompts supply the repository name and a visibility flag (`--public`, `--private`, or `--internal`). For example, `gh repo create project-name --public`. To clone the repository locally, pass the `--clone` flag.  For more information about possible arguments, see the [GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create).

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.
 
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.
 
  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.
 
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.
In anticipating for your urgent cooperation

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.
 
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.
 
  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.
 
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.
 
In anticipating for your urgent cooperation
 
Thank you, God Bless America.
 
Mr Jamie Dimon,
Director Of Foreign Remittance Department.

	Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																									
	 																																									
	  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																									
	 																																									
	  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																									
	 																																									
	NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																									
	 																																									
	In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																									
	 																																									
	Thank you, God Bless America.

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																										
 																																										
  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																										
 																																										
  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																										
 																																										
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																										
 																																										
In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																										
 																																										
Thank you, God Bless America.

		Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																								
		 																																								
		  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																								
		 																																								
		  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																								
		 																																								
		NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																								
		 																																								
		In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																								
		 																																								
		Thank you, God Bless America.

		Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																								
		Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																								
		for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																								
		payment due to insufficient funds.																																								
		Total charges for 1 items $36																																								
		The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																								
		Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																								
		NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																								
		of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																								
		Here’s what you need to																																								
		do immediately:																																								
		Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																								
		and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																								
		account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																								
		been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																								
		way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																								
		branch.																																								
		It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																								
		#barcode																																								
		Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																								
		the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																								
		subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																								
		overdrawn.																																								
		Here are your current																																								
		account settings:																																								
		Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																								
		up this service.																																								
		Overdraft Coverage: Your account is currently Opted In. You or your joint owner may revoke your																																								
		opt-in or opt-out choice at any time. To learn more about PNC Overdraft Solutions, visit us online at																																								
		pnc.com/overdraftsolutions. To manage both your Overdraft Coverage and Overdraft Protection																																								
		settings, call 1-877-588-3605, visit any branch, or sign on to PNC Online Banking, and select the																																								
		Overdraft Solutions link under the Account Services section.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
Create Pull Request action will:
1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
   - untracked (new) files
   - tracked (modified) files
   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.
## Documentation
- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)
- [Examples](docs/examples.md)
- [Updating to v3](docs/updating.md)
## Usage
```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Make changes to pull request here
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```
You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v3.x.x`
### Action inputs
All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

| `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base.

### Action outputs
The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs.
Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
```
### Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.
Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.
Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.
How the action behaves:
- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.
- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
- If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).
#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.
This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.
- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`
- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`
- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`
### Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.
Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).
```yml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```
### Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
### Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Create or Update Project Card
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
        with:
          project-name: My project
          column-name: My column
          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
```
## Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.
Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.
```yml
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Make changes to pull request

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:

A *[commit](/articles/github-glossary#commit)* is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.
When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a *README* file. *README* files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your *README* file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
Let's commit a change to the *README* file.
1. In your repository's list of files, click ***README.md***.
  ![README file in file list](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-open-readme.png)
2. Above the file's content, click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="The edit icon" %}.
3. On the **Edit file** tab, type some information about yourself.
  ![New content in file](/assets/images/help/repository/edit-readme-light.png)
{% data reusables.files.preview_change %}
5. Review the changes you made to the file. You will see the new content in green.
  ![File preview view](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-review.png)
{% data reusables.files.write_commit_message %}
{% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
{% data reusables.files.propose_file_change %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

Now that you have created a project, you can start committing changes.

*README* files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your *README* file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository. Follow these steps to add a *README* file.

1. In the command line, navigate to the root directory of your new project. (This directory was created when you ran the `gh repo create` command.)
1. Create a *README* file with some information about the project.

    ```shell
    echo "info about this project" >> README.md
    ```

1. Enter `git status`. You will see that you have an untracked `README.md` file.

    ```shell
    $ git status

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
      README.md

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```

1. Stage and commit the file.

    ```shell
    git add README.md && git commit -m "Add README"
    ```

1. Push the changes to your branch.

    ```shell
    git push --set-upstream origin HEAD
    ```

{% endcli %}

## Next steps

You have now created a repository, including a *README* file, and created your first commit on {% data variables.location.product_location %}.

{% webui %}

* You can now clone a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository to create a local copy on your computer. From your local repository you can commit, and create a pull request to update the changes in the upstream repository. For more information, see "[Cloning a repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)" and "[Set up Git](/articles/set-up-git)."

{% endwebui %}

* You can find interesting projects and repositories on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and make changes to them by creating a fork of the repository. {% data reusables.getting-started.fork-a-repository %}

* {% data reusables.getting-started.being-social %}

* {% data reusables.support.connect-in-the-forum-bootcamp %}

Manually running a workflow
To manually run a-multi-line-multi-command-line_build_script_runner-powwershell-WIZARD_setup-installation-set-up-WIZARD'@WORKSFLOW.md :
workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.
on: workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."
Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:
jobs: my_job: name: deploy to staging runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:
ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."
Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.
To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.
- name: Setup Node uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: '10.x
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.
- name: Install Dependencies run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.
For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run cross 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:
jobs: test: name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy: matrix: node_version: ['8', '10', '12'] os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }} uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }} - name: npm install, build and test run: | npm install npm run build --if-present npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context
For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:
steps: - run: 
NPC :AUTOMATE :publish.yml :
 if :true.:continue-on-false :
 github.event_name == 'Pushs/Response.md '

Java Launcher run Java applications and applets by double-clicking class files; view class source codes and class hierarchies in graphic format by right-clicking; display contents of jar and zip files without extracting them by right-clicking and allow to save selected files from jar or zip to disk; compile thousands of Java files by right-clicking, execute and debug thousands of applications and applets by right-clicking. Two features of creating: create Windows EXE files from Java applications with user icons, arguments of Java main method, system and user classpaths create executable JAR files. Last feature is named Java-Help-System, which can auto generate an advanced Help System for J2SE documentations without spending user's any time and energy.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.


￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.

## Frontmatter
[YAML Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is an authoringconvention popularized by Jekyll that provides a way to add metadata to pages.It is a block of key-value content that lives at the top of every Markdown file.
The following frontmatter values have special meanings and requirements for this site.There's also a schema that's used by the test suite to validate every page's frontmatter.See [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).
### `versions`
- Purpose: Indicates the [versions](../lib/all-versions.js) to which a page applies.See [Versioning](#versioning) for more info.- Type: `Object`. Allowable keys map to product names and can be found in the `versions` object in [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).- This frontmatter value is currently **required** for all pages.- The `*` is used to denote all releases for the version.
Example that applies to GitHub.com and recent versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:
```yamltitle: About your personal dashboardversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.20'```
Example that applies to all supported versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:(but not GitHub.com):
```yamltitle: Downloading your licenseversions: ghes: '*'```
You can also version a page for a range of releases. This would version the page for GitHub.com, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions 2.22 and 3.0 only:
```yamlversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.22 <3.1'```
### `redirect_from`
- Purpose: List URLs that should redirect to this page.- Type: `Array`- Optional
Example:
```yamltitle: Getting started with GitHub Desktopredirect_from: - /articles/first-launch/ - /articles/error-github-enterprise-version-is-too-old/ - /articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows/```
See [`contributing/redirects`](contributing/redirects.md) for more info.
### `title`
- Purpose: Set a human-friendly title for use in the rendered page's `<title>` tag and an `h1` element at the top of the page.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, the page `<title>` will still be set, albeit with a generic value like `GitHub.com` or `GitHub Enterprise`.
### `shortTitle`
- Purpose: An abbreviated variant of the page title for use in breadcrumbs and navigation elements.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, `title` will be used.
|Article type |Maximum character length |--- | --- | |articles	 | 31 ||categories	 |27 ||map topics	 |30 |
Example:
```yamltitle: Contributing to projects with GitHub DesktopshortTitle: Contributing to projects```
### `intro`
- Purpose: Sets the intro for the page. This string will render after the `title`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `permissions`
- Purpose: Sets the permission statement for the article. This string will render after the `intro`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `product`
- Purpose: Sets the product callout for the article. This string will render after the `intro` and `permissions` statement.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `layout`
- Purpose: Render the proper page layout.- Type: `String` that matches the name of the layout.For a layout named `components/landing`, the value would be `product-landing`.- Optional. If omitted, `DefaultLayout` is used.
### `children`
- Purpose: Lists the relative links that belong to the product/category/map topic. See [Index pages](#index-pages) for more info.- Type: `Array`. Default is `false`.- Required on `index.md` pages.
### `featuredLinks`
- Purpose: Renders the linked articles' titles and intros on product landing pages and the homepage.- Type: `Object`.- Optional.
The list of popular links are the links displayed on the landing page under the title "Popular." Alternately, you can customize the title "Popular" by setting the `featuredLinks.popularHeading` property to a new string.
Example:
```yamlfeaturedLinks: gettingStarted: - /path/to/page guides: - /guides/example popular: - /path/to/popular/article1 - /path/to/popular/article2 popularHeading: An alternate heading to Popular```
### `showMiniToc`
- Purpose: Indicates whether an article should show a mini TOC above the rest of the content. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `true` on articles, and `false` on map topics and `index.md` pages.- Optional.
### `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel`
- Purpose: Indicates the maximum heading level to include in an article's mini TOC. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Number`. Default is `2`. Minimum is `2`. Maximum is `3`.- Optional.
### `allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`
- Purpose: Indicates whether a page is allowed to have a title that differs from its filename. For example, `content/rest/reference/orgs.md` has a title of `Organizations` instead of `Orgs`. Pages with this frontmatter set to `true` will not be flagged in tests or updated by `script/reconcile-ids-with-filenames.js`.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `false`.- Optional.
### `changelog`
- Purpose: Render a list of items pulled from [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) on product landing pages (ex: `components/landing`). The one exception is Education, which pulls from https://github.blog/category/community/education.- Type: `Object`, properties: - `label` -- must be present and corresponds to the labels used in the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) - `prefix` -- optional string that starts each changelog title that should be omitted in the docs feed. For example, with the prefix `GitHub Actions: ` specified, changelog titles like `GitHub Actions: Some Title Here` will render as `Some Title Here` in the docs feed).- Optional.
### `defaultPlatform`
- Purpose: Override the initial platform selection for a page. If this frontmatter is omitted, then the platform-specific content matching the reader's operating system is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable. For example, most GitHub Actions runners use Linux and their operating system is independent of the reader's operating system.- Type: `String`, one of: `mac`, `windows`, `linux`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamldefaultPlatform: linux```
### `defaultTool`
- Purpose: Override the initial tool selection for a page, where tool refers to the application the reader is using to work with GitHub (such as GitHub.com's web UI, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop) or the GitHub APIs (such as cURL or the GitHub CLI). If this frontmatter is omitted, then the tool-specific content matching the GitHub web UI is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable.- Type: `String`, one of: `webui`, `cli`, `desktop`, `curl`, `codespaces`, `vscode`.- Optional.
```yamldefaultTool: cli```
### `learningTracks`- Purpose: Render a list of learning tracks on a product's sub-landing page.- type: `String`. This should reference learning tracks' names defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).- Optional
**Note: the featured track is set by a specific property in the learning tracks YAML. See that [README](../data/learning-tracks/README.md) for details.*
### `includeGuides`- Purpose: Render a list of articles, filterable by `type` and `topics`. Only applicable when used with `layout: product-sublanding`.- Type: `Array`- Optional.
Example:
```yamlincludeGuides: - /actions/guides/about-continuous-integration - /actions/guides/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-workflow-templates - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-powershell```
### `type`- Purpose: Indicate the type of article.- Type: `String`, one of the `overview`, `quick_start`, `tutorial`, `how_to`, `reference`.- Optional.
### `topics`- Purpose: Indicate the topics covered by the article. The topics are used to filter guides on some landing pages. For example, the guides at the bottom of [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides) can be filtered by topics and the topics are listed under the guide intro. Topics are also added to all search records that get created for each page. The search records contain a `topics` property that is used to filter search results by topics. For more information, see the [Search](/contributing/search.md) contributing guide. Refer to the content models for more details around adding topics. A full list of existing topics is located in the [allowed topics file](/data/allowed-topics.js). If topics in article frontmatter and the allow-topics list become out of sync, the [topics CI test](/tests/unit/search/topics.js) will fail.- Type: Array of `String`s- Optional: Topics are preferred for each article, but, there may be cases where existing articles don't yet have topics or a adding a topic to a new article may not add value.
### `contributor`- Purpose: Indicate an article is contributed and maintained by a third-party organization, typically a GitHub Technology Partner.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `URL`.- Optional.
### `communityRedirect`- Purpose: Set a custom link and link name for `Ask the GitHub community` link in the footer.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `href`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamlcontributor: name: ACME, inc. URL: https://acme.example.com/```
### Escaping single quotes
If you see two single quotes in a row (`''`) in YML frontmatter where you might expect to see one (`'`), this is the YML-preferred way to escape a single quote. From [the YAML spec](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-12-10.html):
> In single quoted leaves, a single quote character needs to be escaped. This is done by repeating the character.
As an alternative, you can change the single quotes surrounding the frontmatter field to double quotes and leave interior single quotes unescaped.
## Autogenerated mini TOCs
Every article on the help site displays an autogenerated "In this article" section (aka mini TOC) at the top of the page that includes links to all `H2`s in the article by default.
* To make the mini TOC include additional (or fewer) heading levels, you can add [`miniTocMaxHeadingLevel` frontmatter](#miniTocMaxHeadingLevel) to specify the maximum heading level. For example: `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel: 3`* To disable the mini TOC for a specific article, you can add this frontmatter: [`showMiniToc: false`](#showMiniToc)
Mini TOCs do not appear on product landing pages, category landing pages, or map topic pages.
Make sure not to add hardcoded "In this article" sections in the Markdown source or else the page will display duplicate mini TOCs.
## Versioning
A content file can have **two** types of versioning:
* [`versions`](#versions) frontmatter (**required**) * Determines in which the versions the page is available. See [contributing/permalinks](../contributing/permalinks.md) for more info.* Liquid statements in content (**optional**) * Conditionally render content depending on the current version being viewed. See [contributing/liquid-helpers](../contributing/liquid-helpers.md) for more info. Note Liquid conditionals can also appear in `data` and `include` files.
### Free-pro-team vs. GitHub.com versioning
As of early 2021, the `free-pro-team@latest` version is **only** supported in content files (in both frontmatter and Liquid versioning) and throughout the docs site backend. It is **not** user facing. A helper function called `lib/remove-fpt-from-path.js` removes the version from URLs. Users now select `GitHub.com` in the Article Versions dropdown instead of `Free, Pro, Team`.
The convenience function allows us to continue supporting a consistent versioning structure under-the-hood while not displaying plan information to users that may be potentially confusing.
## Filenames
When adding a new article, make sure the filename is a [kebab-cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) version of the title you use in the article's [`title`](#title) frontmatter. This can get tricky when a title has punctuation (such as "GitHub's Billing Plans"). A test will flag any discrepancies between title and filename. To override this requirement for a given article, you can add [`allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`](#allowtitletodifferfromfilename) frontmatter.
## Whitespace control
When using Liquid conditionals in lists or tables, you can use [whitespace control](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/) characters to prevent the addition of newlines that would break the list or table rendering.
Just add a hyphen on either the left, right, or both sides to indicate that there should be no newline on that side. For example, this statement removes a newline on the left side:
```{%- ifversion fpt %}```
## Links and image paths
Local links must start with a product ID (like `/actions` or `/admin`), and image paths must start with `/assets`. The links to Markdown pages undergo some transformations on the server side to match the current page's language and version. The handling for these transformations lives in [`lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links`](lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links.js).
For example, if you include the following link in a content file:
```/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```When viewed on GitHub.com docs, the link gets rendered with the language code:```/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```and when viewed on GitHub Enterprise Server docs, the version is included as well:```/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```
There are transformations for image paths in GitHub Enterprise Server (versions 2.20-3.0) only. Once those versions are deprecation, there will no longer be any transformations for image paths. For more information, see [/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md](/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md).
### Preventing transformations
Sometimes you want to link to a Dotcom-only article in Enterprise content and you don't want the link to be Enterprise-ified. To prevent the transformation, write the link using HTML and add a class of `dotcom-only`. For example:
```html<a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service" class="dotcom-only">GitHub's Terms of Service</a>```
Sometimes the canonical home of content moves outside the docs site. None of the links included in [`lib/redirects/external-sites.json`](/lib/redirects/external-sites.json) get rewritten. See [`contributing/redirects.md`](/contributing/redirects.md) for more info about this type of redirect.
### Index pages
Index pages are the Table of Contents files for the docs site.

## Frontmatter
[YAML Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is an authoringconvention popularized by Jekyll that provides a way to add metadata to pages.It is a block of key-value content that lives at the top of every Markdown file.
The following frontmatter values have special meanings and requirements for this site.There's also a schema that's used by the test suite to validate every page's frontmatter.See [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).
### `versions`
- Purpose: Indicates the [versions](../lib/all-versions.js) to which a page applies.See [Versioning](#versioning) for more info.- Type: `Object`. Allowable keys map to product names and can be found in the `versions` object in [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).- This frontmatter value is currently **required** for all pages.- The `*` is used to denote all releases for the version.
Example that applies to GitHub.com and recent versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:
```yamltitle: About your personal dashboardversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.20'```
Example that applies to all supported versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:(but not GitHub.com):
```yamltitle: Downloading your licenseversions: ghes: '*'```
You can also version a page for a range of releases. This would version the page for GitHub.com, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions 2.22 and 3.0 only:
```yamlversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.22 <3.1'```
### `redirect_from`
- Purpose: List URLs that should redirect to this page.- Type: `Array`- Optional
Example:
```yamltitle: Getting started with GitHub Desktopredirect_from: - /articles/first-launch/ - /articles/error-github-enterprise-version-is-too-old/ - /articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows/```
See [`contributing/redirects`](contributing/redirects.md) for more info.
### `title`
- Purpose: Set a human-friendly title for use in the rendered page's `<title>` tag and an `h1` element at the top of the page.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, the page `<title>` will still be set, albeit with a generic value like `GitHub.com` or `GitHub Enterprise`.
### `shortTitle`
- Purpose: An abbreviated variant of the page title for use in breadcrumbs and navigation elements.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, `title` will be used.
|Article type |Maximum character length |--- | --- | |articles	 | 31 ||categories	 |27 ||map topics	 |30 |
Example:
```yamltitle: Contributing to projects with GitHub DesktopshortTitle: Contributing to projects```
### `intro`
- Purpose: Sets the intro for the page. This string will render after the `title`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `permissions`
- Purpose: Sets the permission statement for the article. This string will render after the `intro`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `product`
- Purpose: Sets the product callout for the article. This string will render after the `intro` and `permissions` statement.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `layout`
- Purpose: Render the proper page layout.- Type: `String` that matches the name of the layout.For a layout named `components/landing`, the value would be `product-landing`.- Optional. If omitted, `DefaultLayout` is used.
### `children`
- Purpose: Lists the relative links that belong to the product/category/map topic. See [Index pages](#index-pages) for more info.- Type: `Array`. Default is `false`.- Required on `index.md` pages.
### `featuredLinks`
- Purpose: Renders the linked articles' titles and intros on product landing pages and the homepage.- Type: `Object`.- Optional.
The list of popular links are the links displayed on the landing page under the title "Popular." Alternately, you can customize the title "Popular" by setting the `featuredLinks.popularHeading` property to a new string.
Example:
```yamlfeaturedLinks: gettingStarted: - /path/to/page guides: - /guides/example popular: - /path/to/popular/article1 - /path/to/popular/article2 popularHeading: An alternate heading to Popular```
### `showMiniToc`
- Purpose: Indicates whether an article should show a mini TOC above the rest of the content. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `true` on articles, and `false` on map topics and `index.md` pages.- Optional.
### `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel`
- Purpose: Indicates the maximum heading level to include in an article's mini TOC. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Number`. Default is `2`. Minimum is `2`. Maximum is `3`.- Optional.
### `allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`
- Purpose: Indicates whether a page is allowed to have a title that differs from its filename. For example, `content/rest/reference/orgs.md` has a title of `Organizations` instead of `Orgs`. Pages with this frontmatter set to `true` will not be flagged in tests or updated by `script/reconcile-ids-with-filenames.js`.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `false`.- Optional.
### `changelog`
- Purpose: Render a list of items pulled from [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) on product landing pages (ex: `components/landing`). The one exception is Education, which pulls from https://github.blog/category/community/education.- Type: `Object`, properties: - `label` -- must be present and corresponds to the labels used in the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) - `prefix` -- optional string that starts each changelog title that should be omitted in the docs feed. For example, with the prefix `GitHub Actions: ` specified, changelog titles like `GitHub Actions: Some Title Here` will render as `Some Title Here` in the docs feed).- Optional.
### `defaultPlatform`
- Purpose: Override the initial platform selection for a page. If this frontmatter is omitted, then the platform-specific content matching the reader's operating system is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable. For example, most GitHub Actions runners use Linux and their operating system is independent of the reader's operating system.- Type: `String`, one of: `mac`, `windows`, `linux`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamldefaultPlatform: linux```
### `defaultTool`
- Purpose: Override the initial tool selection for a page, where tool refers to the application the reader is using to work with GitHub (such as GitHub.com's web UI, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop) or the GitHub APIs (such as cURL or the GitHub CLI). If this frontmatter is omitted, then the tool-specific content matching the GitHub web UI is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable.- Type: `String`, one of: `webui`, `cli`, `desktop`, `curl`, `codespaces`, `vscode`.- Optional.
```yamldefaultTool: cli```
### `learningTracks`- Purpose: Render a list of learning tracks on a product's sub-landing page.- type: `String`. This should reference learning tracks' names defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).- Optional
**Note: the featured track is set by a specific property in the learning tracks YAML. See that [README](../data/learning-tracks/README.md) for details.*
### `includeGuides`- Purpose: Render a list of articles, filterable by `type` and `topics`. Only applicable when used with `layout: product-sublanding`.- Type: `Array`- Optional.
Example:
```yamlincludeGuides: - /actions/guides/about-continuous-integration - /actions/guides/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-workflow-templates - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-powershell```
### `type`- Purpose: Indicate the type of article.- Type: `String`, one of the `overview`, `quick_start`, `tutorial`, `how_to`, `reference`.- Optional.
### `topics`- Purpose: Indicate the topics covered by the article. The topics are used to filter guides on some landing pages. For example, the guides at the bottom of [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides) can be filtered by topics and the topics are listed under the guide intro. Topics are also added to all search records that get created for each page. The search records contain a `topics` property that is used to filter search results by topics. For more information, see the [Search](/contributing/search.md) contributing guide. Refer to the content models for more details around adding topics. A full list of existing topics is located in the [allowed topics file](/data/allowed-topics.js). If topics in article frontmatter and the allow-topics list become out of sync, the [topics CI test](/tests/unit/search/topics.js) will fail.- Type: Array of `String`s- Optional: Topics are preferred for each article, but, there may be cases where existing articles don't yet have topics or a adding a topic to a new article may not add value.
### `contributor`- Purpose: Indicate an article is contributed and maintained by a third-party organization, typically a GitHub Technology Partner.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `URL`.- Optional.
### `communityRedirect`- Purpose: Set a custom link and link name for `Ask the GitHub community` link in the footer.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `href`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamlcontributor: name: ACME, inc. URL: https://acme.example.com/```
### Escaping single quotes
If you see two single quotes in a row (`''`) in YML frontmatter where you might expect to see one (`'`), this is the YML-preferred way to escape a single quote. From [the YAML spec](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-12-10.html):
> In single quoted leaves, a single quote character needs to be escaped. This is done by repeating the character.As an alternative, you can change the single quotes surrounding the frontmatter field to double quotes and leave interior single quotes unescaped.
## Autogenerated mini TOCs
Every article on the help site displays an autogenerated "In this article" section (aka mini TOC) at the top of the page that includes links to all `H2`s in the article by default.
* To make the mini TOC include additional (or fewer) heading levels, you can add [`miniTocMaxHeadingLevel` frontmatter](#miniTocMaxHeadingLevel) to specify the maximum heading level. For example: `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel: 3`* To disable the mini TOC for a specific article, you can add this frontmatter: [`showMiniToc: false`](#showMiniToc)
Mini TOCs do not appear on product landing pages, category landing pages, or map topic pages.
Make sure not to add hardcoded "In this article" sections in the Markdown source or else the page will display duplicate mini TOCs.
## Versioning
A content file can have **two** types of versioning:
* [`versions`](#versions) frontmatter (**required**) * Determines in which the versions the page is available. See [contributing/permalinks](../contributing/permalinks.md) for more info.* Liquid statements in content (**optional**) * Conditionally render content depending on the current version being viewed. See [contributing/liquid-helpers](../contributing/liquid-helpers.md) for more info. Note Liquid conditionals can also appear in `data` and `include` files.
### Free-pro-team vs. GitHub.com versioning
As of early 2021, the `free-pro-team@latest` version is **only** supported in content files (in both frontmatter and Liquid versioning) and throughout the docs site backend. It is **not** user facing. A helper function called `lib/remove-fpt-from-path.js` removes the version from URLs. Users now select `GitHub.com` in the Article Versions dropdown instead of `Free, Pro, Team`.
The convenience function allows us to continue supporting a consistent versioning structure under-the-hood while not displaying plan information to users that may be potentially confusing.
## Filenames
When adding a new article, make sure the filename is a [kebab-cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) version of the title you use in the article's [`title`](#title) frontmatter. This can get tricky when a title has punctuation (such as "GitHub's Billing Plans"). A test will flag any discrepancies between title and filename. To override this requirement for a given article, you can add [`allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`](#allowtitletodifferfromfilename) frontmatter.
## Whitespace control
When using Liquid conditionals in lists or tables, you can use [whitespace control](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/) characters to prevent the addition of newlines that would break the list or table rendering.
Just add a hyphen on either the left, right, or both sides to indicate that there should be no newline on that side. For example, this statement removes a newline on the left side:
```{%- ifversion fpt %}```
## Links and image paths
Local links must start with a product ID (like `/actions` or `/admin`), and image paths must start with `/assets`. The links to Markdown pages undergo some transformations on the server side to match the current page's language and version. The handling for these transformations lives in [`lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links`](lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links.js).
For example, if you include the following link in a content file:
```/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```When viewed on GitHub.com docs, the link gets rendered with the language code:```/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```and when viewed on GitHub Enterprise Server docs, the version is included as well:```/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```
There are transformations for image paths in GitHub Enterprise Server (versions 2.20-3.0) only. Once those versions are deprecation, there will no longer be any transformations for image paths. For more information, see [/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md](/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md).
### Preventing transformations
Sometimes you want to link to a Dotcom-only article in Enterprise content and you don't want the link to be Enterprise-ified. To prevent the transformation, write the link using HTML and add a class of `dotcom-only`. For example:
```html<a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service" class="dotcom-only">GitHub's Terms of Service</a>```
Sometimes the canonical home of content moves outside the docs site. None of the links included in [`lib/redirects/external-sites.json`](/lib/redirects/external-sites.json) get rewritten. See [`contributing/redirects.md`](/contributing/redirects.md) for more info about this type of redirect.
### Index pages
Index pages are the Table of Contents files for the docs site. Every product, category, and map topic subdirectory has an `index.md` that serves as the landing page. Each `index.md` must contain a `children` frontmatter property with a list of relative links to the child pages of the product, category, or map topic.
**Important note**: The site only knows about paths included in `children` frontmatter. If a directory or article exists but is **not** included in `children`, its path will 404.
### Creating new sublanding pages
To create a sublanding page (e.g. [Actions' Guide page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides)), create or modify an existing markdown file with these specific frontmatter values:
1. Use the sublanding page template by referencing it `layout: product-sublanding`2. (optional) Include the learning tracks in [`learningTracks`](#learningTracks)3. (optional) Define which articles to include with [`includeGuides`](#includeGuides).
If using learning tracks, they need to be defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).If using `includeGuides`, make sure each of the articles in this list has [`topics`](#topics) and [`type`](#type) in its frontmatter.

-
-*Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will
-be performed on all the supported versions of Caddy.*
-
-[[usage]]
-== Usage
-
-There are sample web sites included with this repository.  To serve the sample
-web site using Caddy, run the s2i build:
-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-$ s2i build https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-caddy.git \
-    --context-dir=0.8/test/test-app openshift/caddy-08-centos7 caddy-test-app
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-The resulting image can be executed using https://docker.com[docker]:
-
--------------------------------------------------------
-$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 caddy-test-app
--------------------------------------------------------
-
-Once the container is running, it should be accessible using:
-
----------------------
-$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
----------------------
-
-[[test]]
-== Test
-
-This repository also provides a test suite to check functionality of simple
-Caddy web sites or applications built on top of the `s2i-caddy` image.  It
-can be executed simply by running the `make test` command:
-
------------------------
-$ cd s2i-caddy
-$ make test VERSION=0.8
------------------------
-
-*Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will

Manually running a workflow
To manually run a-multi-line-multi-command-line_build_script_runner-powwershell-WIZARD_setup-installation-set-up-WIZARD'@WORKSFLOW.md :
workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.
on: workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."
Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:
jobs: my_job: name: deploy to staging runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:
ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."
Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.
To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.
- name: Setup Node uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: '10.x
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.
- name: Install Dependencies run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.
For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run cross 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:
jobs: test: name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy: matrix: node_version: ['8', '10', '12'] os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }} uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }} - name: npm install, build and test run: | npm install npm run build --if-present npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context
For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:
steps: - run: 
NPC :AUTOMATE :publish.yml :
 if :true.:continue-on-false :
 github.event_name == 'Pushs/Response.md '

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.


￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.
