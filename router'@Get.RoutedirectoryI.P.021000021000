Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on docs.github.com ✨.

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon  on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub
Set up Git
GitHub flow
Collaborating with pull requests
Getting started
To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the introduction to working in the docs repository 🎊. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see the GitHub Markdown reference.

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code ✨.

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

Make Changes
Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.



Make changes in a codespace
For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace."

Make changes locally
Install Git LFS.

Fork the repository.

Using GitHub Desktop:

Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
Using the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Install or update to Node.js v16. For more information, see the development guide.

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process⚡.

Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
Your PR is merged!
Congratulations 🎉🎉 The GitHub team thanks you ✨.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub docs.

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can contribute to the docs.

Windows
This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

Regular Expressions: Windows uses \r\n for line endings, while Unix-based systems use \n. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use \r?\n instead of \n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
Paths: Windows systems use \ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix, path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash.
Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
Update Git configuration: git config --system core.longpaths true
Consider using a different Git client on Windows

Frontmatter
YAML Frontmatter is an authoring convention popularized by Jekyll that provides a way to add metadata to pages. It is a block of key-value content that lives at the top of every Markdown file.

The following frontmatter values have special meanings and requirements for this site. There's also a schema that's used by the test suite to validate every page's frontmatter. See lib/frontmatter.js.

versions
Purpose: Indicates the versions to which a page applies. See Versioning for more info.
Type: Object. Allowable keys map to product names and can be found in the versions object in lib/frontmatter.js.
This frontmatter value is currently required for all pages.
The * is used to denote all releases for the version.
Example that applies to GitHub.com and recent versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:

title: About your personal dashboard
versions:
free-pro-team: '*'
enterprise-server: '>=2.20'
Example that applies to all supported versions of GitHub Enterprise Server: (but not GitHub.com):

title: Downloading your license
versions:
enterprise-server: '*'
You can also version a page for a range of releases. This would version the page for GitHub Enterprise Server 2.22 and 3.0 only:

versions:
free-pro-team: '*'
enterprise-server: '>=2.22 <3.1'
redirect_from
Purpose: List URLs that should redirect to this page.
Type: Array
Optional
Example:

title: Getting started with GitHub Desktop
redirect_from:

/articles/first-launch/
/articles/error-github-enterprise-version-is-too-old/
/articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows/
See contributing/redirects for more info.
title
Purpose: Set a human-friendly title for use in the rendered page's <title> tag and an h1 element at the top of the page.
Type: String
Optional. If omitted, the page <title> will still be set, albeit with a generic value like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.
shortTitle
Purpose: An abbreviated variant of the page title for use in breadcrumbs.
Type: String
Optional. If omitted, title will be used.
Example:

title: Contributing to projects with GitHub Desktop
shortTitle: Contributing to projects
intro
Purpose: Sets the intro for the page. This string will render after the title.
Type: String
Optional.
permissions
Purpose: Sets the permission statement for the article. This string will render after the intro.
Type: String
Optional.
product
Purpose: Sets the product callout for the article. This string will render after the intro and permissions statement.
Type: String
Optional.
layout
Purpose: Wrap the page in a custom HTML layout.
Type: String that matches the name of the layout file, without an extension. For a layout named layouts/article.html, the value would be article.
Optional. If omitted, layouts/default.html is used.
mapTopic
Purpose: Indicates whether a page is a map topic. See Map Topic Pages for more info.
Type: Boolean. Default is false.
Optional.
featuredLinks
Purpose: Renders the linked articles' titles and intros on product landing pages and the homepage.
Type: Object.
Optional.
Example:

featuredLinks:
gettingStarted:

/path/to/page
guides:
/guides/example
showMiniToc
Purpose: Indicates whether an article should show a mini TOC above the rest of the content. See Autogenerated mini TOCs for more info.
Type: Boolean. Default is true on articles, and false on map topics and index.md pages.
Optional.
miniTocMaxHeadingLevel
Purpose: Indicates the maximum heading level to include in an article's mini TOC. See Autogenerated mini TOCs for more info.
Type: Number. Default is 3. Minimum is 2. Maximum is 4.
Optional.
allowTitleToDifferFromFilename
Purpose: Indicates whether a page is allowed to have a title that differs from its filename. For example, content/rest/reference/orgs.md has a title of Organizations instead of Orgs. Pages with this frontmatter set to true will not be flagged in tests or updated by script/reconcile-ids-with-filenames.js.
Type: Boolean. Default is false.
Optional.
changelog
Purpose: Render a list of items pulled from GitHub Changelog on product landing pages (ex: layouts/product-landing.html). The one exception is Education, which pulls from https://github.blog/category/community/education.
Type: Object, properties:
label -- must be present and corresponds to the labels used in the GitHub Changelog
prefix -- optional string that starts each changelog title that should be omitted in the docs feed. For example, with the prefix GitHub Actions: specified, changelog titles like GitHub Actions: Some Title Here will render as Some Title Here in the docs feed).
Optional.
defaultPlatform
Purpose: Override the initial platform selection for a page. If this frontmatter is omitted, then the platform-specific content matching the reader's operating system is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable. For example, most GitHub Actions runners use Linux and their operating system is independent of the reader's operating system.
Type: String, one of: mac, windows, linux.
Optional.
Example:
defaultPlatform: linux
learningTracks
Purpose: Render a list of learning tracks on a product's sub-landing page.
type: String. This should reference learning tracks' names defined in data/learning-tracks/*.yml.
Optional
*Note: the first learning track is by-default the featured track.

includeGuides
Purpose: Render a list of articles, filterable by type and topics. Only applicable when used with layout: product-sublanding.
Type: Array
Optional.
Example:

includeGuides:

/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration
/actions/guides/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-workflow-templates
/actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs
/actions/guides/building-and-testing-powershell
type
Purpose: Indicate the type of article.
Type: String, one of the overview, quick_start, tutorial, how_to, reference.
Optional.
topics
Purpose: Indicate the topics covered by the article. The topics are used to filter guides on some landing pages. For example, the guides at the bottom of this page can be filtered by topics and the topics are listed under the guide intro. Topics are also added to all search records that get created for each page. The search records contain a topics property that is used to filter search results by topics. For more information, see the Search contributing guide. Refer to the content models for more details around adding topics. A full list of existing topics is located in the allowed topics file. If topics in article frontmatter and the allow-topics list become out of sync, the topics CI test will fail.
Type: Array of Strings
Optional: Topics are preferred for each article, but, there may be cases where existing articles don't yet have topics or a adding a topic to a new article may not add value.
contributor
Purpose: Indicate an article is contributed and maintained by a third-party organization, typically a GitHub Technology Partner.
Type: Object. Properties are name and URL.
Optional.
Example:
contributor:
name: ACME, inc.
URL: https://acme.example.com/
Escaping single quotes
If you see two single quotes in a row ('') in YML frontmatter where you might expect to see one ('), this is the YML-preferred way to escape a single quote. From the YAML spec:

In single quoted leaves, a single quote character needs to be escaped. This is done by repeating the character.

As an alternative, you can change the single quotes surrounding the frontmatter field to double quotes and leave interior single quotes unescaped.

Autogenerated mini TOCs
Every article on the help site displays an autogenerated "In this article" section (aka mini TOC) at the top of the page that includes links to all H2s and H3s in the article by default.

To make the mini TOC include additional (or fewer) heading levels, you can add miniTocMaxHeadingLevel frontmatter to specify the maximum heading level. For example: miniTocMaxHeadingLevel: 4
To disable the mini TOC for a specific article, you can add this frontmatter: showMiniToc: false
Mini TOCs do not appear on product landing pages, category landing pages, or map topic pages.

Make sure not to add hardcoded "In this article" sections in the Markdown source or else the page will display duplicate mini TOCs.

Versioning
A content file can have two types of versioning:

versions frontmatter (required)
Determines in which the versions the page is available. See contributing/permalinks for more info.
Liquid statements in content (optional)
Conditionally render content depending on the current version being viewed. See contributing/liquid-helpers for more info. Note Liquid conditionals can also appear in data and include files.
Free-pro-team vs. GitHub.com versioning
As of early 2021, the free-pro-team@latest version is only supported in content files (in both frontmatter and Liquid versioning) and throughout the docs site backend. It is not user facing. A helper function called lib/remove-fpt-from-path.js removes the version from URLs. Users now select GitHub.com in the Article Versions dropdown instead of Free, Pro, Team.

The convenience function allows us to continue supporting a consistent versioning structure under-the-hood while not displaying plan information to users that may be potentially confusing.

Filenames
When adding a new article, make sure the filename is a kebab-cased version of the title you use in the article's title frontmatter. This can get tricky when a title has punctuation (such as "GitHub's Billing Plans"). A test will flag any discrepancies between title and filename. To override this requirement for a given article, you can add allowTitleToDifferFromFilename frontmatter.

Whitespace control
When using Liquid conditionals in lists or tables, you can use whitespace control characters to prevent the addition of newlines that would break the list or table rendering.

Just add a hyphen on either the left, right, or both sides to indicate that there should be no newline on that side. For example, this statement removes a newline on the left side:

{%- if currentVersion == 'free-pro-team@latest' %}
These characters are especially important in index pages comprised of list items.

Links and image paths
Local links must start with a product ID (like /actions or /admin), and image paths must start with /assets. The links to Markdown pages undergo some transformations on the server side to match the current page's language and version. The handling for these transformations lives in lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links.

For example, if you include the following link in a content file:

/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply
When viewed on GitHub.com docs, the link gets rendered with the language code:

/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply
and when viewed on GitHub Enterprise Server docs, the version is included as well:

/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply
There are transformations for image paths in GitHub Enterprise Server (versions 2.20-3.0) only. Once those versions are deprecation, there will no longer be any transformations for image paths. For more information, see /assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md.

Preventing transformations
Sometimes you want to link to a Dotcom-only article in Enterprise content and you don't want the link to be Enterprise-ified. To prevent the transformation, write the link using HTML and add a class of dotcom-only. For example:

GitHub's Terms of Service
Sometimes the canonical home of content moves outside the docs site. None of the links included in lib/redirects/external-sites.json get rewritten. See contributing/redirects.md for more info about this type of redirect.

Creating new sublanding pages
To create a sublanding page (e.g. Actions' Guide page), create or modify an existing markdown file with these specific frontmatter values:

Use the sublanding page template by referencing it layout: product-sublanding
(optional) Include the learning tracks in learningTracks
(optional) Define which articles to include with includeGuides.
If using learning tracks, they need to be defined in data/learning-tracks/*.yml. If using includeGuides, make sure each of the articles in this list has topics and type in its frontmatter.
