# GitHub Docs 
<!-- omit in toc --> 
This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com).
GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.
Use the table of contents icon <img src="./assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.
## Contributing.md
See [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started with our project. 
We accept different [types of contributions](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/types-of-contributions.md), including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.
On the GitHub Docs site, you can click the make a contribution button at the bottom of the page to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.

For more complex contributions, you can open an issue using the most appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose) to describe the changes you'd like to see.
If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) for something to work on. When ready, check out [Getting Started with Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.
