+üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
+- Checkout your repository
+- Perform a container image build
+- Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
+- Log in to your OpenShift cluster
+- Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet
+‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
+1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
+2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
+- https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
+- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
+- https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
+3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
+4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
+The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
+but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
+5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

Ability to skip confirmation via a flag
Open ‚Ä¢ AliabbasMerchant opened about 2 days ago ‚Ä¢ 1 comment


#1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future), we should add support for the  -y  flag

Ability to skip confirmation via a flag
Open ‚Ä¢ AliabbasMerchant opened about 2 days ago ‚Ä¢ 1 comment


#1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future), we should add support for the  -y  flag
